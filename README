CSCI 364
Artificial Intelligence
Cole Peppis, Benjamin Stern, and Matt Swinton

This directory should include all of the files necessary to run our
project. If you desire to change the parameters, such as board size,
number of animals, select the gameManager object in the scene hierarchy
section of Unity's GUI. The parameters can then be changed via the
object inspector tab. If you wish to change any of the characteristics
of the animals, you can select their prefabs from the
Assets/Resources/Prefab folder in the project tab, and change their
parameters via the object inspector tab as well.

Matt wrote most of the Buffalo script, Cole wrote most of the Wolf
script, and Ben wrote most of the genetics and reproduction code, but we
all helped to write the majority of the project.


We have adhered to the Honor Code in this project.
